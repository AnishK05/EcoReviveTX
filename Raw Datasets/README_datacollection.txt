DATA & FILE



OVERVIEW

1. Description of dataset


These data were generated to investigate the effects of the 'Grain for Green program' in China on soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycling processes. Specifically, we searched literature on the topic of 
'Grain for Green program' in China and belowground functions during 1900-2019, by means of Web of Science, Google Scholar and China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database. We restricted our analyses to changes 
in soil C, N and P cycling processes, when croplands were restored to semi-natural ecosystems (i.e., forest, shrubland and grassland). The papers collected were further screened on the basis of the following criteria. 
First, both agricultural and restored sites shared similar climate and soil conditions. Second, studies were performed with paired sites, using chronosequence or retrospective design. Third, soil depth and restoration time 
were clearly described. Finally, belowground functions were explicitly shown by their mean values and sample sizes. Based on these criteria, we identified 293 studies from 272 papers that were suitable for our analysis. 
Overall, our dataset (2900 observations) spanned a mean annual precipitation range of 116 to 1980 mm and annual temperature range of -0.7 to 20.5 °„C. Restored ecosystems included forests, shrublands and grasslands, 
with the restoration time from 1 to 100 years. Belowground processes represented multiple functions of storing nutrients (soil organic carbon-SOC, total N-TN, total P-TP), transforming nutrients (microbial biomass C-MBC, 
microbial biomass N-MBN, microbial biomass P-MBP, invertase, catalase, urease, phosphatase) and supplying nutrients (available N-AN, available P-AP).
